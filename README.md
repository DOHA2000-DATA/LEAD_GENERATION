# 📊 Data Analysis Project - Customer Conversion Insights  

## ✅ Project Status: Completed  
This project has been successfully completed. The final report includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of customer conversion insights.  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project aims to analyze customer conversion rates based on different factors such as income bin, demographic details, and behavioral attributes. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and visualize trends that can help optimize business strategies.  

## 🚀 Objectives  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, normalizing columns, and converting data types.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding customer conversion trends.  
- **Data Visualization**: Presenting key insights through graphical representations.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## 🔥 How to Run  
1. **Clone this repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/data-analysis-project.git
   cd data-analysis-project
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. **Run the Jupyter notebooks step by step:**  
   - Start with `DATA_CLEANING.ipynb` to prepare the data.  
   - Proceed with `DATA_ANALYSIS.ipynb` for exploratory insights.  
   - Use `DATA_VISUALISATION.ipynb` to generate charts and visualizations.  

## 📊 Key Insights  
### 🔹 Data Cleaning Results
- Missing values were filled using mean imputation (for numerical values) and categorical filling for missing categories.
- Data was standardized and formatted for further analysis.

### 🔹 Data Analysis Findings
- Higher income groups tend to have higher conversion rates.
- Certain demographic groups exhibit significantly different conversion rates.
- Temporal trends indicate peaks in lead conversions at specific times.

### 🔹 Data Visualization Outcomes
- **Conversion Rate by Income Bin:** Line and bar charts showing trends in conversion.
- **Customer Segmentation Analysis:** Pie charts and heatmaps for understanding key clusters.
- **Time-Based Trends:** Insights on seasonal customer behaviors.

## 📌 Technologies Used  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation.  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive analysis.  

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Use **Machine Learning** to predict conversion rates.  
- Expand dataset with additional demographic variables.  
- Develop a real-time dashboard for monitoring customer trends.
